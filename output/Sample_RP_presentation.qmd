## Introduction

## Topic

<br>

> Diverse trajectory patterns of depression will be identified with a relevant
> role of time-varying determinants (e.g. cognitive function) on the severity of
> depressive symptoms.

## Context

<br>

Project [*Edad con Salud*](http://edadconsalud.com/?lang=en)

-   Longitudinal cohort Ageing study

-   Two cohorts: original (2011) and refreshment (2019)

-   Waves: 4 (original cohort), 2 + lockdown substudy (refreshment sample)

-   One more wave projected for each cohort

## Research questions {.smaller}

<br>

**Primary RQ:**

-   Do there exist different, theoretically relevant, trajectories of
    depression, throughout the course of the lifetime?

::: fragment
**Secondary RQQ:**
:::

1.  Do certain time-invariant (e.g. sociodemographics) or time-varying (e.g.
    cognitive function, treatment(s)) covariates predict the trajectories of the
    individuals?

2.  How does depression relate to health outcomes (i.e., disease burden,
    disability, and mortality)?

3.  What has been the impact (shock) of the pandemic/lockdown measures on the
    different depression trajectory classes?

## Measures

<br>

On Cohort 2011:

-   **Primary outcome:** ICD10-based 12-month depressive episode (dichotomous /
    severity-coded)

-   **Covariates:** sociodemographics (age, sex, SES, education), cognitive
    function, loneliness (...?)

-   **Other relevant outcomes:** health score, disability, mortality

## Modeling approach {.smaller}

<br>

**Group-based Trajectory Modeling** [@nagin1999]

## Modeling approach

<br>

**Advantages:**

-   Covariates may be included in the model

-   May account for nonrandom attrition [e.g. mortality, @haviland2011]

-   Multiple/joint trajectories can be modeled [@nagin2001]
