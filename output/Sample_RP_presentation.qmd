## Introduction

<br>

-   20% of lifetime prevalence of Major Depressive episode
    [@worldfederationformentalhealth2012].
-   Signifcant proportion experience onset at 60+ [@hasin2005].
-   Distinct impact on health and wellbeing [@mclaughlin2011].

::: notes
-   one in five individuals will experience one episode at some point in their
    lifetime (WHO, 2012)

-   the most likely period for the onset of the first episode of depression
    extends from 20s to mid-40s, but there are differences: a significant
    proportion of individuals experience their first episode at older ages.

-   Late onset depression has a distinctive impact on health and wellbeing.
    Depression in older adults is associated with increased risk of morbidity,
    decreased physical, cognitive and social functioning, and higher mortality.

**Modeling:** Group-based Trajectory Modeling [@nagin1999].
:::

::: notes
Xiang & Cheng find distinct trajectories of probability of MDE.

We expect to find similar results in a Spanish, representative sample.

But their modeling approach is a fixed-effect model; does not take into account
individual variability.

Depression binary-coded, while we will apply an ordinal severity coding with
three severity levels, apart from absence of depression.

## Objectives

<br>

-   Investigate distinct courses of depression in Spanish adult longitudinal
    cohort.

-   Identify covariates associated with differential evolution of depression.

-   Determine the effect of the different trajectory patterns on associated
    health outcomes.

::: notes
-   Trajectories

-   differ by gender, marital status, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle
    behaviours, cognitive reserve, or the presence of physical or mental
    comorbidities among other variables (Köhler et al., 2018), while the
    time-varying impact of these factors over the old age are yet unknown (e.g.
    cognitive function).

-   E.g. poor cognitive function, suicidal behaviour, mortality

## Design

<br>

Project [*Edad con Salud*](http://edadconsalud.com/?lang=en)

-   Longitudinal cohort Ageing study

-   Two cohorts: **original (2011)** and refreshment (2019)

-   Waves: **4 (original cohort)**, 2 + lockdown substudy (refreshment sample)

-   (One more wave projected for each cohort)

## Research questions {.smaller}

<br>

**Primary RQ:**

-   Do there exist different, theoretically relevant, trajectories of
    depression, throughout the course of the lifetime?

<br>

::: fragment
**Secondary RQQ:**
:::

1.  Do certain time-invariant (e.g. sociodemographics) or time-varying (e.g.
    cognitive function, treatment(s)) covariates predict the trajectories of the
    individuals?

2.  How does depression relate to health outcomes (i.e., disease burden,
    disability, and mortality)?

## Measures

<br>

On Cohort 2011:

-   **Primary outcome:** ICD10-based *inter-survey* depressive episode
    (severity-coded)

-   **Covariates:** sociodemographics (age, sex, SES, education), cognitive
    function, loneliness, ...

-   **Other relevant outcomes:** health score, disability, mortality

## Modeling approach {.smaller}

<br>

**Growth Mixture Modeling** [@muthén1999]

<br>

::: fragment
**Advantages:**

-   Random effects

-   Covariates may be included in the model

-   Account for mortality [@haviland2011]

-   Multiple/joint trajectories [@nagin2001]
:::

<br>

::: fragment
**Disadvantages:**

-   Complexity
:::

::: notes
Similar to GBTM but...

contemplates random effects to account for individual variability

Can account for nonrandom attrition and multiple trajectories, as is the case
with the GBTM

Difficult to find convergence
:::

## Data analysis

<br>

1.  Descriptive analyses

2.  Fit GMM to longitudinal MDE data and interpret classes

3.  Predict latent class membership from covariates

4.  Include health-related outcomes by modeling:

    -   Attrition (mortality)

    -   Multiple-trajectory model (helath-related outcomes)

## Limitations

<br>

-   Time resolution

<br>

-   Non-coetaneous subjects

<br>

-   Computational resources

::: notes
Few datapoints, 3 years apart

Limitations of modeling approach must be acknowledged

Models are computationally expensive
